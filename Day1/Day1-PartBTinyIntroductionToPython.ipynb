    "## Caveats\n",
    "* This is not a comprehensive introduction to Python but aims at merely providing you with just enough to understand the use of Machine Learning libraries.\n",
    "* If you write code, you will use libraries from other people.\n",
    "* If you use code from other people, you will have to get used to reading documentations of code.\n",
    "* Get used to reading those yourself and to googling your questions and error messages.\n",
    "* You can find the official documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/\n",
    "* Stackoverflow is a great resource for technical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## There are still two version of Python (2.x and 3.x) - we use 3.x\n",
    "* There are still two version of Python being used in parallel. \n",
    "* We recommend to use Python 3.x instead of Python 2.x. \n",
    "* The code in our practical sessions will be based on Python 3.x.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to run Python\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run Python in various ways, e.g. from the console or in Jupyter notebooks.\n",

    "### Console\n",
    "* On your Mac, it comes preinstalled: Just open the console, write python and hit enter\n",

    "### Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "* For this lecture, we will use interactive Jupyter notebooks which can run Python but also allow for text and images\n",
    "* Furthermore, we use Jupyter notebooks that are hosted online and run in the cloud"
