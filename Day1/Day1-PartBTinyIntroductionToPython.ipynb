    "\n",
    "## Caveats and advice\n",
    "* This is not a comprehensive introduction to Python but aims at merely providing you with just enough to understand our practical coding sessions.\n",
    "* If you are as excited about Machine Learning as we are, we encourage you to find further resources and tutorials on your own. We are happy to provide pointers.\n",
    "* If you write code, you will use libraries from other people.\n",
    "  * If you use code from other people, you will have to get used to reading documentations of code.\n",
    "  * Get used to googling and reading those yourself.\n",
    "  * You can find the official Python documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/\n",
    "* Error messages are normal. We all make typos and forget things.\n",
    "  * Do not be afraid of error messages. They are there to help you.\n",
    "  * Try to read the error message first. What could it mean for your code? Is the line indicated where the error happened?\n",
    "  * Google the main error message (without any bits that are specific to you or your code) \n",
    "  * Stackoverflow is a great resource for technical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## There are still two version of Python (2.x and 3.x) - we use 3.x\n",
    "* There are still two version of Python being used in parallel. \n",
    "* We recommend to use Python 3.x instead of Python 2.x. \n",
    "* The code in our practical sessions will be based on Python 3.x.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to run Python\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run Python in various ways, e.g. from the console or in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Console\n",
    "* On your Mac, it comes preinstalled: Just open the console, write python and hit enter\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/PartB/python_console.png\" alt=\"Python console on Mac\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "* For this lecture, we will use interactive Jupyter notebooks which can run Python but also allow for text and images\n",
    "* Furthermore, we use Jupyter notebooks that are hosted online and run in the cloud"
