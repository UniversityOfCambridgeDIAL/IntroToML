    "## 1.1 What is Jupyter\n",
    "* Project Jupyter is a non-profit, open-source project.\n",
    "* Born out of the IPython Project in 2014\n",
    "* The project evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all major programming languages, including Python\n",
    "* More on Jupyter: http://jupyter.org/about.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 What can Jupyter notebooks do?\n",
    "* As you can see, Jupyter notebooks are interactive notebooks run in the browser\n",
    "* They consist of stacked cells\n",
    "* Basically, each cell can either contain:\n",
    "  * descriptive elements (text, images, etc.) in the Markdown language; OR...\n",
    "  * code that you want to execute (following the standards of the language you are running, in our case: Python 3.x)\n",
    "* The benefit is that you can combine rich explanatory elements like animations and text with code that you can edit and execute.\n",
