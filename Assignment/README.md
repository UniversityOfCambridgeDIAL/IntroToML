# Instructions for the MET Machine Learning Assignment

## Coursework Instructions (this is the 3rd coursework within the INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT module)

Belfast City local authorities regularly monitor the trees and collect data about them and their condition. You will find information including the type of tree (street tree or park tree), the species, the shape, the location, and condition.
Your task is it to check if and to what extent the other information provided in the dataset is sufficient to predict the type of tree ('TYPEOFTREE').

(i) Build an appropriate prediction model for the type of tree ('TYPEOFTREE') using the data science pipeline that was discussed during the lecture and practical session. This includes:
* an exploratory data analysis, 
* formulating the task as a data science problem, 
* data cleaning and pre-processing, choosing at least two appropriate Machine Learning methods, 
* building and evaluating these Machine Learning models, 
* your reflections on the difference in performance between the models, and 
* general conclusions, limitations and ideas for possible improvements. 

[10 marks]

You are required to submit your results in form of an [Azure Notebook](https://notebooks.azure.com/). This is the type of notebook we also work with during our practical coding sessions. The notebook shall be in form of a report so that it contains both your code, results of your code (e.g. figures) as well as your written reflections (as you would provide in a normal report).

Please submit your work in form of a PDF version of your notebook, but also provide a URL to your Azure Notebook in addition to the PDF so that we can access the notebook directly.

Your submission MUST be your own work and must demonstrate your own reflections about the dataset as well as your understanding of what you are doing in each step and why. You are allowed and encouraged to use the Machine Learning and other Python libraries we have worked with in the practical coding sessions.

The data set and further more detailed instructions can be found on our public repository: https://github.com/UniversityOfCambridgeDIAL/IntroToML/Assignment/.

Please note that the URL alone is not sufficient; we need the PDF in any case.

### How you will be assessed

The assignment is designed to challenge you to think about the data science process rather than to simply apply the methods. Your report will be marked how well you worked through the following steps of the process:

|Marking criteria|
|------|
|1. A sensibly conducted exploratory data analysis where you demonstrate how you tried to examine the data|
|2. The formulation of a valid, achievable data science problem|
|3. Data cleaning and preprocessing|
|4. Rationale for the choice of the machine learning methods|
|5. Building and evaluating your Machine Learning model |
|6. Conclusions|

We prepared some questions that might help you to conform to the report requirements:

1. Can the problem be answered through applying machine learning?
2. Is it a unsupervised/supervised and classification/regression/clustering/... problem?
3. Does the dataset contain invalid data entries?
4. Is the dataset skewed or unbalanced?
5. Does the dataset require application of a normalisation method? If yes, which one?
6. What types of variables (e.g. categorical, ...) does the dataset contain?
7. Do chosen machine learning methods work well with the type of dataset that is analysed?
8. Are chosen machine learning methods appropriate for the formulated problem?
9. Did you divide the dataset into train/cross-validation/test subsets?
10. What metrics are you using to evaluate the performance of the model? Are they appropriate for the dataset?
11. Which models perform well on the dataset, which do not, and why?
12. When the model's performance can be considered as sufficient?
13. Does the model solve the original problem?

You are encouraged to use more than just one machine learning method to explore their potential in solving the problem. Bear in mind that the consistency of the data science process you follow is the most important marking criteria. This means it is OK if your model does not perform perfectly well, as long as you can explain why and suggest possible improvements. This assignment is _not_ a competition for the highest accuracy.
